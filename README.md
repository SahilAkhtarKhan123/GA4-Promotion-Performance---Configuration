# GA4-Promotion-Performance---Configuration

Implemente the first+last click banner touch custom variable at the event level for four websites within a specific session. You can now access the first and last click promotion name values with EE events using the following dimensions:
first_touch_promotion_name
last_touch_promotion_name

Additionally we need to pass the params with GA4 EE events tags manually. And need to created the CD in GA4 properties as well. 

Happy Tagging!
